Welcome to the Arctic Fox sandbox! Here, you can play around with different automations in a Codespace. This gives you realtime feedback on applying changes and experimenting with automations. 

# Setup
Refer to <a href="https://github.com/icii-arcticfox/TutorialHome#how-to-use-tutorials/" target="_blank">Tutorial How To</a> to start the Sandbox and switch between automations. 

# Automations
Different automations are used in various groups in the sandbox. When you open the Arctic Fox pane, and you have activated Arctic Fox, the drop down list will allow you to select different sandbox environments. Within each environment, 1 or more automations will be used. The theme of the environment will follow the name given in the drop down. 

# Feedback
When using the sandbox we ask that you provide feedback to Icii on your experience with Arctic Fox. As you experiment with automations, please think about the areas of your HDL design / testing process that could benefit from automation. Our goal is to make your development faster and easier!
